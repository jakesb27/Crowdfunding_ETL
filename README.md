## Summary | ETL Mini Project

This ETL (Export, Transform, Load) mini project consisted of extracting data from .xlsx files and importing them into a Pandas Dataframe. We transformed the data as needed to then export four csv files that would later represent four tables in our Postgres DB. The ERD model was created using <a href="https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/" target="_blank">QuickDBD</a> and exported into a sql file. Once all tables were created in the database, SELECT queries were ran to verify the data was loaded correctly.
